# OpenMuscle-Band

**Status:** Archived (Legacy Hardware)  
**License:** [CERN-OHL-S v2.0](https://github.com/Open-Muscle/OpenMuscle-Band/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Overview

The **OpenMuscle-Band** is the original prototype of the OpenMuscle project‚Äîa wearable forearm band equipped with 12 pressure sensors designed to detect muscle contractions and predict finger movements. This open-source hardware was developed to provide biometric data for machine learning applications in prosthetics and human-computer interaction.

## Hardware Specifications

- **Sensors:** 12 Hall Effect Sensors (49E) arranged in 6 dual-input sensor cells
- **Microcontrollers:** 3 √ó ESP32-C3 modules
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (UDP transmission)
- **Sampling Rate:** Up to 1200 samples per second
- **Construction:** 3D-printed enclosures with integrated springs and magnets
- **Firmware:** MicroPython

## Repository Contents

- `BOM/`: Bill of Materials detailing all components used
- `KiCad/`: PCB design files for the sensor array
- `STLs/`: 3D-printable files for enclosures and mounts
- `Schematics/`: Electrical schematics of the system

## Legacy Information

## Getting Started

To replicate or study the OpenMuscle-Band:

1. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Print the enclosures from the `STLs/` directory.
   - Assemble the sensor cells with Hall Effect Sensors, magnets, and springs.
   - Connect the sensors to the ESP32-C3 modules as per the schematics.

2. **Firmware Installation:**
   - Flash MicroPython onto each ESP32-C3 module.
   - Upload the appropriate `boot.py` and `main.py` scripts to handle data acquisition and transmission.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Use the band to collect muscle contraction data.
   - Transmit data via UDP to a host machine for processing.

4. **Machine Learning (Optional):**
   - Utilize the scripts from the legacy repository to train models that predict finger movements based on sensor data.
